# Mozart Musical Dice

Playing around with Musikalisches W端rfelspiele.

> "A [Musikalisches W端rfelspiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel) (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using dice to randomly generate music from precomposed options. These games were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different games were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely choosing a random number."

This project was inspired by Stanford University's [Mozart Musical Dice Game](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2023/wayne-musical-dice-game/) nifty assignment.

## Directions

A *Musikalisches W端rfelspiel* is a process for generating music by concatenating a random sequence of precomposed musical fragments. In this exercise, we will "compose" a Viennese waltz in the style of Mozart by playing a sequence of 32 WAV files that are chosen at random (from a set of 272) according to the results of throwing dice, as described below.

### Minuet

The minuet consists of a sequence of 16 musical phrases (numbered 0 to 15), each chosen at random. For the purposes of this project, a musical phrase is short musical fragment, approximately two seconds in length. To determine which WAV file to play for phrase *i*, roll *two fair dice*.

If the sum is *s*, then play `minueti-s.wav`. For example, if you roll an 8 for phrase 3, then play `minuet3-8.wav`. Note that each roll has 11 possible outcomes (2 through 12) but some outcomes (such as 7) are much more likely than others (such as 2 or 12).

### Trio

The trio consists of a sequence of 16 phrases (numbered 0 to 15), each chosen at random. To determine which WAV file to play for phrase *i*, roll *one fair die*.

If the result is *s*, then play `trioi-s.wav`. For example, if you roll a 6 for phrase 15, then play `trio15-6.wav`.


## Credits

The 272 provided musical phrases were published in 1792 by Mozart's publisher Nikolaus Simrock and [attributed to Mozart](https://imslp.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel,_K.516f_(Mozart,_Wolfgang_Amadeus)). The WAV files were generated using [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) and the open-source [MuseScore_General.sf3](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/soundfonts-and-sfz-files) soundfont; they were post-processed using [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
