# Mozart Musical Dice

Playing around with Musikalisches Würfelspiele.

> "A [Musikalisches Würfelspiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel) (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using dice to randomly generate music from precomposed options. These games were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different games were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely choosing a random number."

This project was inspired by Stanford University's [Mozart Musical Dice Game](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2023/wayne-musical-dice-game/) nifty assignment.
